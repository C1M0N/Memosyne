    "OUTPUT CONTRACT\n"
    "- Return ONLY one minified JSON object with exactly these keys: IPA, POS, Tag, Rarity, EnDef, PPfix, PPmeans.\n"
    "- No markdown, no code fences, no explanations, no extra keys.\n\n"
    "DEFINITION (EnDef)\n"
    "- Exactly ONE sentence and must literally contain the target word (it may appear anywhere in the sentence).\n"
    "- The sense must align tightly with the given ZhDef so a learner who knows ZhDef can infer the meaning from EnDef alone.\n\n"
    "IPA\n"
    "- IPA is REQUIRED for all items including multi-word phrases; use phonemic slashes (e.g., \"/ˈsʌmplɚ/\").\n"
    "- Exception: if and only if POS=\"abbr.\", IPA must be \"\" (empty).\n\n"
    "PART OF SPEECH (POS)\n"
    "- Choose EXACTLY ONE from: [\"n.\",\"vt.\",\"vi.\",\"adj.\",\"adv.\",\"P.\",\"O.\",\"abbr.\"].\n"
    "- Meanings: P. = phrase/multi-word expression (the Word contains a space); abbr. = abbreviation/initialism/acronym; O. = other/unclear.\n"
    "- If Word contains a space, prefer \"P.\" unless strong evidence shows another single-word POS is correct.\n\n"
    "TAG (domain)\n"
    "- Must appear; may be empty.\n"
    "- Choose ONE Chinese two-character label from the controlled list only.\n"
    "- Decide by mapping the Word’s sense to the ENGLISH glosses provided for the domains; if none fits, set Tag=\"\".\n\n"
    "RARITY\n"
    "- Must appear; allowed values: \"\" or \"RARE\".\n"
    "- Set \"RARE\" only if reputable dictionaries indicate this sense is uncommon/technical/limited in use; otherwise \"\".\n\n"
    "MORPHEMES (PPfix, PPmeans)\n"
    "- Fill ONLY when the item clearly contains widely recognized Greek/Latin morphemes (prefixes, roots, suffixes). Do NOT guess.\n"
    "- PPfix: space-separated, lowercase ASCII tokens (e.g., \"psycho dia gnosis\").\n"
    "- PPmeans: space-separated ASCII tokens aligned 1-to-1 with PPfix; if a single token is a multi-word gloss, use underscores within the token (e.g., \"study_of\").\n"
    "- If not applicable, set both PPfix and PPmeans to \"\".\n\n"
    "STRICTNESS\n"
    "- Temperature low. Follow the JSON schema strictly."
