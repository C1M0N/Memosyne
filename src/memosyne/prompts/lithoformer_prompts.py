VERBATIM MANDATE (CRITICAL)
- DO NOT paraphrase or shorten any wording.
- COPY stems, step lines (A./B./C./D.) and option texts VERBATIM.
- Preserve punctuation, parentheses, acronyms, numbers (e.g., 'DSM-5-TR', '(positively charged ion)').
- Allowed edits ONLY:
  (a) remove leading numbering tokens at the very start of the stem (e.g., '1.', '(1)', 'Q1:');
  (b) insert '<br>' for line breaks;
  (c) replace figures/images with placeholders '§Pic.N§' in order of appearance.

STRICT SEPARATION
- NEVER put any answer choices (like 'a. ...', 'A. ...') inside the stem. All choices must go into 'options'.
- Remove UI/grade artifacts from the source such as: 'Correct answer:', 'Incorrect answer:', ', Not Selected', 'Not Selected'.
- Remove naked markers 'A.'/'B.'/'C.'/'D.' that appear WITHOUT text.

TYPE DECISION RULES
- If lettered choices (A./B./C./D.) exist in the source, the item is MCQ, even if the stem has blanks/underscores.
- Use CLOZE ONLY when there are underscores '____' in the stem AND there are NO lettered choices.
- Use ORDER when the prompt asks to place/order AND there are labeled step lines A./B./C./D., plus separate sequence choices (e.g., 'B,A,C,D').
- For figure-only MCQ (labels A/B/C/D without descriptions), set options A='A', B='B', C='C', D='D' (others empty).

OUTPUT CONTRACT (STRICT SCHEMA - ALL FIELDS REQUIRED)
- Return ONLY one compact JSON object with key: "items".
- "items" is an array; each item MUST include ALL these fields:
  - "qtype": "MCQ" or "CLOZE" or "ORDER".
  - "stem": string (VERBATIM; may include '<br>' and '§Pic.N§').
  - "steps": array of strings.
    * For ORDER: put the labeled step lines VERBATIM (e.g., ['A. Step one', 'B. Step two', ...]).
    * For MCQ/CLOZE: MUST provide empty array [].
  - "options": object with ALL six keys "A","B","C","D","E","F" (all strings, REQUIRED).
    * For MCQ: fill A-D (or A-F) with actual option text; unused keys set to "".
    * For ORDER: options are the SEQUENCE choices (e.g., {"A":"B,A,C,D", "B":"", "C":"", ...}).
    * For CLOZE: ALL six keys MUST be empty strings ({"A":"", "B":"", "C":"", "D":"", "E":"", "F":""}).
  - "answer": string.
    * For MCQ/ORDER: one uppercase letter (A-F).
    * For CLOZE: empty string "".
  - "cloze_answers": array of strings.
    * For CLOZE: provide exact fills in order (e.g., ["amplitude", "generate"]).
    * For MCQ/ORDER: MUST provide empty array [].
- No markdown code fences, no commentary, no extra keys.
- Do NOT create items that are merely answer summaries (e.g., '... in the proper sequence: D, C, A, B.').

STYLE
- Stems: only remove leading numbering tokens; otherwise copy verbatim.
- Keep parentheses and qualifiers.
- For blanks '____', list fills in cloze_answers (renderer will place '{{...}}' or keep underscores as needed)."""

LITHOFORMER_USER_TEMPLATE = """Source markdown quiz:

---
{md}
---

TASK
- Extract questions with choices and the correct answer letter if explicitly available in the markdown.
- If answer not explicit, leave "answer" as empty string "".
- Clean stems: remove numbering like "1.", "(1)", "Q1:", etc.
- Ensure options text are concise.
- Return JSON only, matching the schema strictly.
