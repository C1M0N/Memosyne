He had left his history class and was walking back to his dorm when his heart suddenly started racing and his chest tightened. Adam found it difficult to breathe and began sweating and trembling. He assumed he was having a heart attack and thought he was going to die. He made it back to his room and collapsed on the floor, gasping for air. After a few terrifying minutes, the sensations went away, and his breathing returned to normal. The ordeal left Adam confused and frightened. He became even more worried after having several more similar episodes during the rest of the semester.<br>((::在亚当的大一新生涯开始时，他经历了一次非常可怕的事件。他刚上完历史课，走回宿舍时，心脏突然开始狂跳，胸口紧绷。亚当感到呼吸困难，开始出汗和颤抖。他认为自己正在心脏病发作，并以为自己要死了。他回到房间，倒在地板上，喘不过气来。经过几分钟的恐慌，他的感觉消失了，呼吸恢复正常。这次经历让亚当感到困惑和害怕。之后，他在整个学期中又经历了几次类似的发作，更加担心。))<br><br>Over winter break, Adam stayed with his mother and stepfather and visited with his father and stepmother as well. They were all concerned, and because both of Adam's grandfathers died of heart attacks, they urged him to be evaluated. Adam visited his family doctor, only to be told he was in perfect health and that his heart showed no signs of trouble. He asked for and received a referral to a cardiologist, who told him the same thing. Rather than reassure him, the doctors' comments made him even more anxious. He was constantly worried that he might die or that he might lose control of his bodily functions when the next episode hit and survive but be horribly embarrassed. Unfortunately, Adam could never predict when the episodes might happen, so he felt like he couldn't protect himself from such embarrassment. They occurred at all hours of the day and in a variety of situations. According to Adam, one of the worst happened when he was on a date. His girlfriend totally freaked out, and they've had little contact since.

Whereas he was once very sociable, he now prefers to keep to himself. Throughout Adam's sophomore year, his friends gradually saw him less and less frequently. He declined invitations to parties, rarely had friends over, and never seemed to be in the mood to see a movie or grab some coffee. These days, he absolutely refuses to go anywhere there might be a crowd, citing his intense anxiety about such situations. In fact, he hardly ever leaves his room because he fears venturing out on his own.<br>((::根据亚当的朋友们，这些攻击对他的生活产生了重大影响。曾经非常外向的他，现在更喜欢独处。在亚当的二年级期间，他的朋友们渐渐发现他越来越少。他拒绝参加聚会，几乎不邀请朋友来家里，也似乎从来没有心情去看电影或喝咖啡。如今，他绝对拒绝去任何可能有人员密集的地方，强调自己对这种情况的强烈焦虑。事实上，他几乎不出房间，因为他害怕独自外出。))<br><br>The changes in Adam's behavior have made it very difficult for him to keep up with his studies. His friends report that he hasn't attended classes in weeks and was visibly intoxicated the last time he showed up. When confronted, Adam said that he'd only had a few drinks to calm his nerves. His parents and friends have grown increasingly concerned about his drinking. On the rare occasions when he ventures out of his room, he's usually moderately to severely impaired. Unfortunately, his drinking seems to provide little actual relief. He still has episodes of terror when he feels as if he's having a heart attack, and he constantly worries about when the next episode will occur.<br>((::亚当行为的变化让他很难跟上学业。朋友们报告说，他已经有几周没有上课了，最后一次出现在的时候明显醉酒。当被对质时，亚当说他只是喝了几杯酒来放松神经。他的父母和朋友对他的饮酒愈发担忧。偶尔他出去时，通常是中度至严重醉酒。不幸的是，他的饮酒似乎几乎没有实际缓解。他仍然会在感到自己心脏病发作时感到恐惧，并始终担心下一次发作何时会发生。))<br><br>Adam's condition has produced many changes in his behavior.
