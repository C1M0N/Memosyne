<b>Profiles in Psychopathology:<br>Anxiety Disorders</b><br><br>[Renee, who has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), has been attempting to complete her medical school prerequisites for a few years now but keeps getting "stuck" because she spends a large part of her day worrying.
