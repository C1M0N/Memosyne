The entire time, Katherine was deathly afraid that something would catch fire on the stove. After he finished, Katherine delayed the start of dinner while she rigorously cleaned the stove and made sure that all of the burners were turned off. Throughout dinner, she was distracted by the stove and was constantly looking at it to the point of completely ignoring her fiancé, resulting in an argument. They had had similar disagreements before about Katherine's need to make sure doors to their apartments were locked when they went out and her demand that they return home to make sure, about her need to make sure windows were closed and locked before going to bed at night and getting up repeatedly to check, and similar matters. They had also had disagreements about her penchant for scrubbing kitchens and bathrooms scrupulously and keeping everything organized and neat. This time, though, the argument got particularly heated, and she left halfway through dinner and went home. They soon made up over the phone, and Katherine returned to her fiancé's apartment, only to find that he'd placed a sheet over the stove so that she "wouldn't be distracted by it." Upon seeing this, Katherine ripped the sheet away and began checking the knobs and burners to make sure they were turned off. When her fiancé attempted to calm her down, she pushed him away and left again. Katherine's fiancé phoned her several days later to tell her he was calling off the engagement because it was clear that what he had once regarded as endearing quirks about her behavior were far more serious and disruptive. He left open the possibility of their getting back together, but Katherine, distraught, refused.<br><br>Since then, Katherine has struggled even more than usual. She has become particularly preoccupied with a fear of fire and checks her stove, makes sure appliances like her coffeemaker and microwave are unplugged, and has difficulty shifting her attention away when she is worried about the risk of fire. She has developed a few rituals to calm herself down. She often turns on the burners on her gas stove all the way and slowly counts backward from 10 as she turns each one off. If one doesn't turn off right as she reaches zero, she repeats the process. Furthermore, the knobs on the stove must be absolutely clean, as Katherine is convinced that drips and residue can interfere with turning the stove off completely. Recently, Katherine has called in sick to work on a number of days because she was so overwhelmed with fear of her stove catching fire that she felt she needed to clean it and check it repeatedly. She often calls family and friends to try to distract herself and tries to go out with friends, but going out has become challenging because of her fears. At this point, Katherine's life has been seriously disrupted by her need to check things, whether her stove, her doors, or her windows, and her need to clean. She has lost her fiancé, has missed enough work to interfere with her productivity, and has become increasingly withdrawn from life.<br><br>One important consideration when trying to determine whether someone has a psychological disorder is the extent to which that person's life has been disrupted. Katherine's condition is either producing or has the potential to produce disruptive effects on several kinds of functioning. How has Katherine's condition affected her social functioning?<br>A.
