<b>Profiles in Psychopathology:<br>Trauma and Stressor-related Disorders</b><br><br>[Walter, aged 47 years, is one of the River People, a Pima Indian who is part of the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona. He grew up proud of his history and culture but, like many young people, wanted to see more of the world. Mindful of the legacy of Ira Hayes, also a member of the Gila River Indian Community who had enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during World War II and was one of the six Marines who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, Walter also enlisted in the Marine Corps. He made a career of his service, which he recalled with both pride and humility, and retired after 20 years, returning home, where he worked in law enforcement.<br><br>Walter enjoyed his life in the community but found that as he settled into his largely sedentary job, he was no longer nearly as fit as he had been. His eating habits were shaped by his job schedule and often included too much fast food and coffee as well as alcohol use in his off hours. When he went for his annual physical this year, the doctor had some stern words for him. Walter was overweight, had impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes), and had hypertension. The Pima Indians, in fact, have the highest recorded prevalence of type II diabetes in any known population, and hypertension is a common complication. However, the doctor also talked to Walter about diet, exercise, and stress.<br><br>Walter also tells his doctor that he has been experiencing headaches that cause him excruciating pain and center on his left eye. They only last about an hour at a time but seem to occur in cycles. Sometimes he has several in the course of a day, leaving him exhausted and despondent from the pain. He has attributed these headaches to the pressures of his job, but he also has several family members who do not work in law enforcement and have similar headaches.
