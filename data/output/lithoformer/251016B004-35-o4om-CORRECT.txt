He had left his history class and was walking back to his dorm when his heart suddenly started racing and his chest tightened. Adam found it difficult to breathe and began sweating and trembling. He assumed he was having a heart attack and thought he was going to die. He made it back to his room and collapsed on the floor, gasping for air. After a few terrifying minutes, the sensations went away, and his breathing returned to normal. The ordeal left Adam confused and frightened. He became even more worried after having several more similar episodes during the rest of the semester.<br>((::在亚当大学新生的第一学期初，他经历了一次非常恐怖的事件。他离开历史课并返回宿舍时，心脏突然开始狂跳，胸口紧绷。亚当发现自己呼吸困难，并开始出汗和颤抖。他以为自己要心脏病发作，觉得自己快要死了。他回到房间后，倒在地上，气喘吁吁。经过几分钟的恐怖后，感觉消失了，呼吸恢复正常。这场磨难让亚当感到困惑和害怕。在接下来的学期中，他在经历了几次类似的发作后变得更加担忧。))<br><br>Over winter break, Adam stayed with his mother and stepfather and visited with his father and stepmother as well. They were all concerned, and because both of Adam's grandfathers died of heart attacks, they urged him to be evaluated. Adam visited his family doctor, only to be told he was in perfect health and that his heart showed no signs of trouble. He asked for and received a referral to a cardiologist, who told him the same thing. Rather than reassure him, the doctors' comments made him even more anxious. He was constantly worried that he might die or that he might lose control of his bodily functions when the next episode hit and survive but be horribly embarrassed. Unfortunately, Adam could never predict when the episodes might happen, so he felt like he couldn't protect himself from such embarrassment. They occurred at all hours of the day and in a variety of situations. According to Adam, one of the worst happened when he was on a date. His girlfriend totally freaked out, and they've had little contact since. The only place Adam hasn't had an episode is in his room.<br>((::在寒假期间，亚当和他的母亲及继父呆在一起，还拜访了他的父亲和继母。他们都很担心，因为亚当的两位祖父都是因心脏病去世的，他们敦促他接受评估。亚当看了家庭医生，却被告知他完全健康，心脏没有任何问题。他要求并得到了转到心脏病专家的介绍，专家也告诉他同样的话。医生的评论并没有让他感到安心，反而让他更加焦虑。他总是担心自己可能会死，或者失去对身体功能的控制而生存下来，然而感到极度尴尬。不幸的是，亚当从未能够预测事件何时会发生，因此他觉得自己无法保护自己不受这样的尴尬。他们随时随地发生，场合各异。根据亚当的说法，最糟糕的一次发生在他约会时。他的女友完全崩溃，之后他们几乎没有联系。亚当唯一没有发作的地方就是他的房间。))<br><br>According to Adam's friends, these attacks have had a major impact on his life. Whereas he was once very sociable, he now prefers to keep to himself. Throughout Adam's sophomore year, his friends gradually saw him less and less frequently. He declined invitations to parties, rarely had friends over, and never seemed to be in the mood to see a movie or grab some coffee. These days, he absolutely refuses to go anywhere there might be a crowd, citing his intense anxiety about such situations. In fact, he hardly ever leaves his room because he fears venturing out on his own.<br>((::根据亚当的朋友说，这些攻击对他的生活产生了重大影响。虽然他曾经非常社交，但现在他更喜欢独处。在亚当的二年级中，他的朋友们逐渐越来越少地看到他。他拒绝参加聚会的邀请，很少有朋友来访，似乎也不再有心情去看电影或喝咖啡。如今，他绝对拒绝去任何可能有拥挤人群的地方，称这是因为他对这种情况的强烈焦虑。事实上，他几乎不再离开房间，因为他害怕独自外出。))<br><br>The changes in Adam's behavior have made it very difficult for him to keep up with his studies. His friends report that he hasn't attended classes in weeks and was visibly intoxicated the last time he showed up. When confronted, Adam said that he'd only had a few drinks to calm his nerves. His parents and friends have grown increasingly concerned about his drinking. On the rare occasions when he ventures out of his room, he's usually moderately to severely impaired. Unfortunately, his drinking seems to provide little actual relief. He still has episodes of terror when he feels as if he's having a heart attack, and he constantly worries about when the next episode will occur.<br>((::亚当行为的变化让他很难跟上学业。他的朋友们报告说，他已经好几周没有上课，上次露面时明显喝醉了。当被问及时，亚当说他只是喝了几杯酒来缓解紧张。他的父母和朋友越来越担心他的饮酒。在他难得外出时，通常会有中度到严重的醉酒。不幸的是，他的饮酒似乎并没有提供实际的缓解。他仍然感到恐慌，觉得自己快要心脏病发作，他不停担心下次发作会在何时到来。))<br><br>Adam's condition has produced many changes in his behavior.
