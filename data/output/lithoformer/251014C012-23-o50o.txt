<b>Profiles in Psychopathology:<br>Anxiety Disorders</b><br><br>[Renee, who has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), has been attempting to complete her medical school prerequisites for a few years now but keeps getting "stuck" because she spends a large part of her day worrying. She worries about getting her schoolwork done, her finances, her future—she even worries about worrying.<br>Renee's parents said she has always been a worrier "since birth" and that she worried more than other kids growing up. Renee recalls that by puberty, though, her worries became much more intense. She recalls feeling significantly more fearful, guilty, and confused.

As an adult, Renee deals with negative thoughts running through her head and says she wants to "get out of her skin" but cannot. She has difficulty sleeping, eating, and focusing on anything.
