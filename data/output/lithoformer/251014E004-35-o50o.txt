<b>Case Study:<br>Anxiety Disorders: Adam</b><br><br>[# Case Study:<br>Anxiety Disorders: Adam<br><br>Name: Adam<br>Age: 21<br>Sex: Male<br>Family: Single, no children, parents divorced<br>Occupation: College student, junior year<br><br>Presenting problem: Reports he is unable to attend classes and rarely leaves dorm room<br><br>Near the beginning of Adam's freshman year of college, he experienced a very frightening incident. He had left his history class and was walking back to his dorm when his heart suddenly started racing and his chest tightened. Adam found it difficult to breathe and began sweating and trembling. He assumed he was having a heart attack and thought he was going to die. He made it back to his room and collapsed on the floor, gasping for air. After a few terrifying minutes, the sensations went away, and his breathing returned to normal. The ordeal left Adam confused and frightened. He became even more worried after having several more similar episodes during the rest of the semester.<br><br>Over winter break, Adam stayed with his mother and stepfather and visited with his father and stepmother as well. They were all concerned, and because both of Adam's grandfathers died of heart attacks, they urged him to be evaluated. Adam visited his family doctor, only to be told he was in perfect health and that his heart showed no signs of trouble. He asked for and received a referral to a cardiologist, who told him the same thing. Rather than reassure him, the doctors' comments made him even more anxious. He was constantly worried that he might die or that he might lose control of his bodily functions when the next episode hit and survive but be horribly embarrassed. Unfortunately, Adam could never predict when the episodes might happen, so he felt like he couldn't protect himself from such embarrassment. They occurred at all hours of the day and in a variety of situations. According to Adam, one of the worst happened when he was on a date. His girlfriend totally freaked out, and they've had little contact since. The only place Adam hasn't had an episode is in his room.<br><br>According to Adam's friends, these attacks have had a major impact on his life. Whereas he was once very sociable, he now prefers to keep to himself. Throughout Adam's sophomore year, his friends gradually saw him less and less frequently. He declined invitations to parties, rarely had friends over, and never seemed to be in the mood to see a movie or grab some coffee. These days, he absolutely refuses to go anywhere there might be a crowd, citing his intense anxiety about such situations. In fact, he hardly ever leaves his room because he fears venturing out on his own.<br><br>The changes in Adam's behavior have made it very difficult for him to keep up with his studies. His friends report that he hasn't attended classes in weeks and was visibly intoxicated the last time he showed up. When confronted, Adam said that he'd only had a few drinks to calm his nerves. His parents and friends have grown increasingly concerned about his drinking. On the rare occasions when he ventures out of his room, he's usually moderately to severely impaired. Unfortunately, his drinking seems to provide little actual relief. He still has episodes of terror when he feels as if he's having a heart attack, and he constantly worries about when the next episode will occur.<br><br>Adam's condition has produced many changes in his behavior. One change in Adam's life has been the amount of time he spends in his room. Based on his case history, why does he spend most of his time there?<br>A. There is a danger that he'll have an actual heart attack if he leaves his room.<br>B. He doesn't appear to have any need or reason to leave his room.<br>C.
