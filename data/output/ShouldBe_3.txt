<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>The size of an action potential is independent of the stimulus magnitude, a phenomenon that is referred to as the {{all-or-none}} property of action potentials.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>The electrical potential across a permeable membrane separating different concentrations of ions is most accurately predicted by the {{Goldman}} equation.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are characterized by {{hyperpolarization}} of the postsynaptic membrane.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>The generation of the action potential depends on {{sodium}} channels, which are opened through a process of regenerative depolarization.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>The {{nodes of Ranvier}} are regularly spaced along the length of myelinated axons.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>The enzyme {{acetylcholinesterase}} breaks down molecules of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, stopping its action at synapses.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>Transporter molecules are involved in the {{removal}} of neurotransmitter from the synapse.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>{{Autoreceptors}} inform the presynaptic neurons about the net concentration of transmitter in the synaptic cleft and may regulate future transmitter release.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>Any substance that binds to a receptor is known as a(n) {{ligand}}.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>Simple partial seizures are characterized by {{spike-and-wave}} EEG activity.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>{{Tonic-clonic}} seizures are characterized by periods of enduring contractions alternating with periods of jerky, rhythmic contraction and relaxation.
<b>Chapter 3 Test Bank:<br>Neurophysiology: The Generation, Transmission, and Integration of Neural Signals<br></b><br>Loss of consciousness and symmetrical involvement of the body musculature are characteristic of {{generalized}} seizures.
