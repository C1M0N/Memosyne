```Question
Wilfred Owen (1893–1918) was one of the most prominent British poets during World War I, writing graphically of the experiences of soldiers in the trenches, where he served, and of the horrors of the use of poison gasses. Owen himself suffered several concussions and, after being caught in the explosion of a trench shell that left him unconscious for several days, he was diagnosed with "shell shock" and sent back to England. There, during his recovery, he wrote Strange Meeting:

It seemed that out of battle I escaped
Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped
Through granites which titanic wars had groined.
Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,
Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.
Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared
With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,
Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless.
And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,—
By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell.

Owen returned to active service in 1918 on the front line in France. He received an award for conspicuous gallantry for his actions during the attack on the Fonsomme Line and was killed in battle during the crossing of the Sambre–Oise Canal, one week prior to the signing of the Armistice.

Wilfred Owens' poetry describes his experiences with posttraumatic stress disorder or, as it was called then, shell shock. His poem Dulce et Decorum Est describes his dreams of a fellow soldier suffocating from a poison gas attack:

In all my dreams before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.


What symptom cluster do these dreams fit into?
	a. Changes in arousal	
	b. Avoidance	
	c. Negative mood alterations	
	d. Intrusion symptoms

Owen had several combat-related concussions, including the one that left him unconscious for two days and resulted in his being sent home to recover. What is the relationship between traumatic brain injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder?
	a. Serious head injuries increase the risk of posttraumatic stress disorders but only when they are unintentional (accidental).	
	b. Serious head injuries appear to increase the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder.	
	c. Serious head injuries do not appear to affect the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder.	
	d. Serious head injuries decrease the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder because they interfere with the formation of memories.

```Question
U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth is a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and serves as the junior senator from Illinois. While serving as a helicopter pilot during the Iraq War in 2004, her helicopter was hit by an RPG and she lost her legs and partial use of her right arm. She spent a year recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and received a Purple Heart, the Air Medal, and the Army Commendation Medal. Despite her injuries, she petitioned for a medical waiver that allowed her to continue serving in the Illinois Army National Guard until she retired as a lieutenant colonel in 2014. In 2006, she was appointed director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs, where she started programs for veterans with traumatic brain injury and veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder. In 2009, she was appointed as an Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs, where she addressed issues including homelessness among veterans as well as the unique challenges of female and Native American veterans. In 2012, Duckworth was elected to the House of Representatives and, in 2016, she was elected to the Senate.

Senator Duckworth has acknowledged that she probably has posttraumatic stress disorder, although it is not known whether she has been formally diagnosed. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, she described how, after an e-mail exchange with a fellow pilot who was being deployed back to Iraq, "that night, I closed my eyes and I was in Iraq. It's a dream I have over and over. I'm living an entire day in Iraq. I fly missions. I'm working . . . hard and when I wake up, I'm usually exhausted because I've just spent eight hours on the job in my sleep." Speaking to NPR, she said, "Why did some troops come home from a trauma and survive and thrive? And why do some come home and kill themselves? You could almost say that I'm a success story of someone who survived a trauma."

Duckworth has worked intensively to ensure that veterans have access to treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. One of the treatment approaches used by Veterans Administration mental health professionals involves having veterans confront trauma-related memories, feelings, and situations that they have been avoiding. What approach is this?
	a. TF-CBT	
	b. EMDR	
	c. ECT	
	d. PET

	a. Low levels of epinephrine	
	b. Low levels of activity in the amygdala	
	c. Minimal cortisol secretion

```Question
Deaf culture is known for its closeness and mutual support. Arising from shared language (in the United States, American Sign Language, or ASL) and experiences, often including state residential schools specifically for Deaf and hard-of-hearing children and youth. Deaf culture values solidarity, heritage and history, communication, and pride. The importance of Deaf culture and the worldwide Deaf community was demonstrated in a recent mass shooting.

The news bulletins were all too familiar—a mass shooting, this time in Lewiston, Maine, with the shooter still at large and the motivation unknown. As in other mass shootings, there was conflicting news about the number of dead and injured and about progress in the investigation. This time, however, there was a significant difference. Four members of the Deaf community, who were simply out having a good time bowling, had been killed, and at least three were among the injured. And from the beginning, that would render the response to the tragedy more fraught because the media was, all too often, failing to provide equitable access to information by not showing ASL interpreters in their streams. When the Deaf community protested, the state's public safety commissioner began a news conference with a stern announcement: "For the consideration of the four Deaf victims and their families, we are requesting that the ASL interpreter is in all frames for language access. They are grieving and have a right to know the latest information."

For members of the Deaf community, this battle for access and recognition is a long one that has been made more challenging because of historical wrongs. In Maine, for example, the only school for Deaf and hard-of-hearing-individuals, which was attended by three of the four individuals who were killed, was shut down because of an appalling and sustained history of abuse, including sexual abuse, of the students. It took decades for the state to acknowledge the wrongs that were done, apologize, and compensate the victims. That shared legacy of trauma added to the tight bonds among members of the Deaf community.

However, the worldwide Deaf community rose to the challenge and provided support, tangible and intangible, to the Deaf community in Lewiston. They mobilized to ensure that interpreters were available, not just on news streams, but in other settings, including those in which someone might seek help of some sort. They provided a safe space for talking or simply being, whether online or in-person, they provided needed assistance, and they provided the solidarity and mutuality that are so valued in Deaf culture.

Consider the response of the Deaf community to the mass shooting. Which characteristic might tend to increase the risk that members of the community would experience acute stress disorder?
	a. Participating in a group activity	
	b. Being accepted by hearing individuals	
	c. Having a history of previous trauma	
	d. Communicating via ASL

At age 18, Serena began experiencing "really splitting" migraine headaches that went "from the left to the right side of [her] head." These impacted her concentration and her game, in particular, her unparalleled serve. In 2004, she became dizzy, nauseated, and unable to focus during a tennis match, and lost in the first round. Serena has noted that during times such as this, "you want to just crawl under your bed and stay there. I know it doesn't look like it affected my tennis, but, especially in the sun, playing with [it] makes it worse."

What term is applied to medical disorders like migraines, which can be worsened by stress?
	a. Psychophysiological	
	b. Biopsychosocial	
	c. Biogenetic

```Question
Walter, aged 47 years, is one of the River People, a Pima Indian who is part of the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona. He grew up proud of his history and culture but, like many young people, wanted to see more of the world. Mindful of the legacy of Ira Hayes, also a member of the Gila River Indian Community who had enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during World War II and was one of the six Marines who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, Walter also enlisted in the Marine Corps. He made a career of his service, which he recalled with both pride and humility, and retired after 20 years, returning home, where he worked in law enforcement.

Walter enjoyed his life in the community but found that as he settled into his largely sedentary job, he was no longer nearly as fit as he had been. His eating habits were shaped by his job schedule and often included too much fast food and coffee as well as alcohol use in his off hours. When he went for his annual physical this year, the doctor had some stern words for him. Walter was overweight, had impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes), and had hypertension. The Pima Indians, in fact, have the highest recorded prevalence of type II diabetes in any known population, and hypertension is a common complication. However, the doctor also talked to Walter about diet, exercise, and stress.

Walter is concerned about getting his blood pressure under control in order to avoid complications of high blood pressure. Chronic hypertension can lead to which of the following, which in turn increases the risk of stroke and heart attack?
	a. Hypercholesterolemia	
	b. Arteriosclerosis	
	c. Bradycardia	
	d. Atheromata
