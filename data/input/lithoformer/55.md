# Case Study:
Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders: Lena

## 1
```Question
Name: Lena
Age: 48
Sex: Female
Family: Widow, two children
Occupation: Delivery driver
Presenting problem: Nightmares and sadness after robbery

Lena is a German immigrant who moved to Boston after the death of her husband several years ago. She initially had great difficulty finding a job as many employers were unwilling to hire an immigrant who spoke little English. Determined to support her family, Lena was persistent in her job search and in learning English, and eventually she secured a position as a delivery driver for a local florist.

Two weeks ago, Lena was robbed while making a delivery. She pulled over to double-check the address and before she knew what was happening, a man smashed the passenger side window, unlocked the door, and climbed into the van. He pointed a gun at her head while yelling, and although Lena was terrified that she would be killed, the experience also felt surreal, almost like it was happening to someone else. At some point, the man pressed the gun against her and shouted, "Is this all the money you have?" Just then, someone came up to the van asking, "Everything all right in there?" Lena heard a gunshot and crawled into the back of the van as her assailant fled. She has no idea how long she remained there and can't remember any details of her attacker's face or clothes.

Ever since the robbery, Lena has found it hard to concentrate. She struggles to fall asleep and has disturbing nightmares about the attack nearly every night. She often calls her family and friends, looking for support. Lena has a great deal of difficulty discussing the robbery. She breaks down and cries whenever she describes it, so she tries not to think about it and avoids the neighborhood where it occurred. She was unable to provide much information to the police at all and they doubt that the crime will be solved. Lena returned to work several days after the robbery because she needed the money but still cannot bear to be in the delivery van. For now, she's helping with various chores in the shop, but her boss really needs her to be making deliveries.

Overall, Lena often feels extremely sad but is also constantly on edge. Things that used to simply get her attention briefly, like an unexpected sound or being tapped on the shoulder, are now absolutely terrifying. The other day, her cat jumped down from a bookcase and made a loud thud, and Lena shrieked in fear and shook for almost an hour afterwards, feeling hypervigilant and overwhelmed. Lena has never been diagnosed with a psychological disorder but thinks she desperately needs professional help. She does not drink alcohol, is not currently taking any medications or drugs, and has no history of significant physical health problems.

Mental Status Exam

Psychologists often conduct a mental status exam, consisting of systematic observations of several different key areas of functioning, while interviewing or observing a person. This is the mental status exam checklist Lena's therapist completed during their first meeting.

In order for Lena to be diagnosed with a trauma- or stress-related disorder, her symptoms must produce significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Does Lena meet this requirement and if so, how?
	a. Yes, she often feels extremely sad.	
	b. No, her emotional changes are relatively mild, and she does not appear to be distressed.	
	c. Yes, she has become a shut-in and rarely ventures outside her home.
