Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders: Hannah

```Question
Name: Hannah
Age: 28
Sex: Female
Family: Single, lives with family
Occupation: Unemployed
Presenting problem: Loss of vision

Hannah has a long history, with a long list of physical complaints. She has all sorts of musculoskeletal pain, including neck and knee pain. She complains of vision problems, nausea, numbness, painful urination, and menstrual irregularities. She is constantly anxious and preoccupied with the severity of her symptoms, causing her to lose sleep and feel fatigued. She hasn't had a full eight hours of sleep in over six months, and she says she would be happy to get at least five hours of sleep a night. When she can't sleep, she'll spend hours online researching her various symptoms; she also does this researching for a majority of the day. She currently lives with her parents and is unable to keep a job because she frequently calls in sick with various symptoms. Her parents are quite concerned about Hannah and try to help her as much as they can, including by providing her with housing, food, and lots of emotional support. Her elderly grandmother often bakes special treats for Hannah, brings her small gifts, sits by her side, and listens to her concerns. On the other hand, Hannah's younger sister, who completed university and works in a high-paying job in finance, has expressed resentment and accuses her sister of just being lazy and wanting attention. She has had enough of Hannah's complaints, as have most of Hannah's friends, who often avoid returning her messages and texts.

Hannah is hoping her upcoming appointment with a new specialist, well known for research on vision loss, will finally help her get answers to her problems and on the road to recovery. As expected, the specialist has requested she list all hospital visits she has had during the previous year. All of the dates, attending physicians, and symptoms Hannah has compiled for the specialist are listed in the Doctor Visit History section.

Doctor Visits in Past Year
