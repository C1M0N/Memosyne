```Question
A.J. Brown was a storekeeper when, in March of 1887, he knocked on his landlord's door and asked him where he was. Brown, who now gave his name as Ansel Bourne (1826–1915), claimed to have suddenly awakened to realize he was buying and selling merchandise and feared that he might be accused of being a burglar. Upon learning that he was in Norristown, Pennsylvania, he claimed to have no idea how he had gotten there. Concerned, his landlord took Brown to a doctor, where upon learning it was March 17, Brown claimed that the last date he recalled was January 18, when he traveled by horse and carriage from his home in Coventry, Rhode Island, to Providence, withdrew some money from the bank to pay bills, and visited his nephew prior to a planned visit with his sister. 

Bourne had a difficult early life. After his parents separated due to his father's alcoholism, he was sent to live with another family. At 18, he set out on his own, made his living as a carpenter, and married, but in his early 20s began experiencing bouts of severe headaches and weakness. While recovering from one such episode, he claimed to experience a dramatic conversion in which, after stating he would rather be "struck deaf, dumb, and blind" than attend church, he suddenly lost consciousness, only to awaken and discover he was deaf, unable to speak, and blind. He was carried home, recovered, and became an itinerant evangelical preacher. He remarried after his first wife died, and his second wife convinced him to give up itinerant preaching and become a farmer, which he did without known disruption until 1887, when he experienced an episode of what would now be diagnosed as dissociative fugue.

Which structure of Ansel Bourne's brain was most likely inhibited during his dissociative amnesia?
	a. The hippocampus
	b. The hypothalamus
	c. The locus coeruleus
	d. The amygdala

If Bourne were alive today and were to see a therapist, what would the treatment approach be?
	a. Because symptoms of dissociative amnesia remit spontaneously, treatment is contraindicated.
	b. Although symptoms of dissociative amnesia often remit spontaneously, it is essential to uncover the childhood traumas that caused the amnesia.
	c. Even when the symptoms of dissociative amnesia remit spontaneously, treatment of the underlying structural brain abnormalities is needed.
	d. Because symptoms of dissociative amnesia remit spontaneously, treatment of any underlying depression or stress reactions is recommended.

```Question
As an author, actress, screenwriter, and director, Lena Dunham does not shy away from exposing her personal battles in her creative work. In her award-winning HBO series Girls, Dunham stars as the main character and writes scenes that reflect her own struggles with obsessive-compulsive behaviors. In one episode, her uncontrollable need to clean her ears results in a punctured eardrum.

As a child, Dunham believed she had numerous illnesses, including appendicitis, typhoid, jaundice, and AIDS. In her memoir, she states that "the list of things that keep me up at night" include but are "not limited to: …leprosy, unclean meat, foods I haven't seen emerge from their packaging, foods my mother hasn't tasted first so that if we die we die together…" Dunham is also preoccupied with the side effects of potential treatments for illnesses. In another episode of Girls, her alter ego, Hannah, anxiously starts Googling some of her worries: "Do millions of microbes really live on our skin?" "How does your body know to stop breathing?" Dunham's own life experiences, as well as those of the characters she writes and plays, are consistent with illness anxiety disorder, once called hypochondria.

Like Dunham, individuals with illness anxiety disorder tend to present with which characteristic?
	a. They tend to catastrophize symptoms.	
	b. They are typically malingering.	
	c. They do not attempt to verify that they are ill.	
	d. They take the word of medical professionals.

```Question
During the worst of the pandemic, when schools were closed and opportunities for in-person socialization were limited, there was a curious, international outbreak of apparently unexplained tics among teens. The teens with this disorder were very unlike those with Tourette syndrome, a tic disorder that is more common in males, usually has its onset in childhood, often involves simple motor or vocal tics, has an insidious onset, and includes a premonitory sensation. Those who were referred for evaluation during the pandemic were predominantly female, had abrupt and explosive tic onset in adolescence, had elaborate tics involving complex behavioral sequences, and had no premonitory sensations. The tics often worsened in the presence of others, which is also not characteristic of the tics in Tourette syndrome. Moreover, the people with this disorder were four times as likely to have an anxiety disorder and five times more likely to have a depressive disorder as those with Tourette syndrome or other primary tic disorders.

Epidemiologic investigation revealed an interesting pattern: Many of the individuals with the disorder had watched videos on social media purporting to show individuals with Tourette syndrome experiencing tics. These videos are known to be inaccurate. For example, the tics in the videos are strongly influenced by the environment and involve aggression and throwing objects as well as long phrases and self-injurious behavior, all of which are uncommon in Tourette syndrome. This "new" disorder, which has been labeled tic-like behavior after social media (TLB-SM), is now viewed as a type of conversion disorder and treated predominantly with cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Which characteristic would you expect to find with respect to the symptoms exhibited by the teens who had this rapid onset tic disorder during the pandemic?
	a. The symptoms are induced by taking drugs or other substances.	
	b. The symptoms are deliberately faked to get attention.	
	c. The symptoms do not correspond to neurological findings.	
	d. The symptoms change rapidly, depending on the situation.

```Question
As a teenager, Lacey Spears loved children. She worked as a babysitter and later in a day care and even took some college nursing courses to help her care for children. She became pregnant from a brief relationship and cared for her son, Garnett, herself because she claimed his father did not want to be involved, something he later denied. Caring for Garnett was challenging because he was diagnosed with failure to thrive as a very young infant and at nine weeks had surgery that was supposed to reduce his intractable vomiting. After discharge from the hospital, Spears reported that her son refused to take a bottle, and he was airlifted to a medical center with life-threatening dehydration. Doctors found he had an extremely high sodium level, which can cause fatal brain swelling, but they were not able to identify why his sodium level was so high.

Garnett continued to experience health problems and at nine months had a G-tube implanted, but he continued to have feeding problems and was in and out of hospitals. Spears and her son moved to New York. There, Garnett was seen by a pediatric gastroenterologist, who was suspicious about why a healthy child needed a G-tube which the mother refused to have removed because she contended he needed occasional supplemental feedings. Shortly after Garnett turned five, he became acutely ill and, once again having an extremely high sodium level, was airlifted to a tertiary care medical center. Two days later, he was declared brain dead and placed on life support. Hospital officials asked law enforcement to investigate, and they found evidence that Spears was deliberately feeding her son large amounts of salt through his G-tube. Garnett was removed from life support and died. Five months later, Spears was arrested and charged with murder, and was eventually convicted of the depraved indifference murder of a child by deliberately overdosing him with salt.

Although neither the prosecution nor the defense brought up Munchausen by proxy syndrome, the still-popular term for factitious disorder imposed on another, some experts have suggested that the conduct of Lacey Spears is consistent with the disorder. What is the presumed motivation in factitious disorder imposed on another?
	a. To relieve intolerable feelings of anxiety and anger
	b. To get back at other people
	c. To get donations of money and goods
	d. To get attention from medical personnel and others

In media interviews after her conviction, Spears denied that she has factitious disorder imposed on another. Is this surprising?
	a. No, because doing so would mean that she would automatically lose custody of any children she might later have.
	b. Yes, because individuals with the disorder usually brag about how they outsmarted the medical establishment.
	c. No, because individuals with the disorder maintain that they are loving caregivers who are trying to care for a seriously ill individual.
	d. Yes, because individuals with the disorder are usually terribly remorseful about the harm they have caused.

```Question
Amber Rose's symptoms started three days after she was in a car accident. In addition to frequent flareups of pain all over her body, she has sleep problems and brain "fog," which she describes as having a head full of cotton candy. Limited restorative sleep makes her pain worse. She also experiences "a lot of emotionality," including depression and anxiety, both because of her pain and its impact on her career and social life.

Simple activities seem insurmountable to Amber Rose due to her low energy levels and sensitivity. She aches everywhere. Amber Rose notes that balancing her energy levels, engaging in gentle exercise, recognizing the importance of how she interprets and responds to her pain, using stress management and relaxation techniques, and having a sense of humor are important tools for managing her condition and for maintaining "some sense of control."

Amber Rose has fibromyalgia, a difficult-to-diagnose disorder that does not have a widely accepted, specific diagnostic test but that appears to reflect some form of dysfunction in the nervous system. It is characterized by widespread pain and tenderness that often comes and goes and is treated symptomatically. How might a diagnostician differentiate between fibromyalgia or other chronic pain disorders and somatic symptom disorder?
	a. By whether the distress seems out of proportion to the pain
	b. Using imaging studies of the brain
	c. By the score of the pain severity scale
	d. Using reports about dysfunction from people close to the individual
