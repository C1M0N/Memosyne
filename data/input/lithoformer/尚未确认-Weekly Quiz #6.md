Fill in the blank (3 words): ________ ________ _________ function as the sensory receptors of the auditory system.
```
```Answer
inner hair cells
```

## 2
```Question
Select a statement that accurately describes an aspect of auditory transduction.

A. Hyperpolarization of a peripheral auditory neuron (presynaptic) due to the bending of stereocilia causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release from that neuron; this, in turn, decreases the frequency of action potential generation in outer hair cells (postsynaptic).

B. Depolarization of an inner hair cell (presynaptic) due to the bending of stereocilia causes an increase in neurotransmitter release from that hair cell; this, in turn, increases the frequency of action potential generation in peripheral auditory neurons (postsynaptic).

C. Depolarization of a peripheral auditory neuron (presynaptic) due to the bending of the basilar membrane causes an increase in neurotransmitter release from that neuron; this, in turn, increases the frequency of action potential generation in stereocilia (postsynaptic).

D. Action potentials in an inner hair cell (presynaptic) due to the bending of stereocilia cause an increase in neurotransmitter release from that hair cell; this, in turn, increases the frequency of action potential generation in an outer hair cell (postsynaptic).

```Question
Suppose you hear a cricket chirping somewhere to your right. Which of the following statements would be correct?

A. The sound of the cricket would be received by both ears, while its neural representation would be received only by the right primary auditory cortex.
B. The sound of the cricket would be received only by the left ear, while its neural representation would be received by both the left and right primary auditory cortices.
C. The sound of the cricket would be received by both ears, while its neural representation would be received only by the left primary auditory cortex.
D. The sound of the cricket would be received only by the right ear, while its neural representation would be received by both the left and right primary auditory cortices.

## 4
```Question
Otosclerosis involves a bony outgrowth of the stapes, one of the bones of the middle ear. Which of the following forms of hearing loss would be most likely to result from otosclerosis?

A. Conductive hearing loss
B. Sensorineural hearing loss
C. Thalamic hearing loss
D. Central hearing loss

## 5

A. Cochlea
B. Semicircular canals
C. Utricle
D. Saccule
```
```Answer
b
```

## 6
```Question
Fill in the blank: there are ______ varieties of cone cells found within the retina.
```
```Answer
three
```

## 7
```Question
In which of the following structures can retinal ganglion cells terminate (i.e., where might their axon terminals be found)?

A. Optic tract
B. Optic chiasm
C. Primary visual cortex
D. Thalamus
```
```Answer
d
```

## 8
```Question
At which levels of the geniculostriate pathway would you see retinotopic organization?

A. Only the retina
B. Only the primary visual cortex
C. Retinotopy is observed throughout the geniculostriate pathway.
D. Only the thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus)
```
```Answer
c
```

## 9
```Question
Which of the following best explains the phenomenon of foveal overrepresentation at the level of the primary visual cortex?

A. The fovea is overrepresented at the level of the primary visual cortex because it is the only portion of the retina receiving input from both halves of the visual field. 
B. Because the fovea contains a higher density of rods than any other portion of the retina, it is overrepresented at the level of the primary visual cortex.
C. Because the fovea occupies a large portion of the retina's surface area, the visual information it transduces occupies a proportionally large volume of primary visual cortex.
D. Because the fovea represents the site of our sharpest vision in the retina, the visual details projecting onto the fovea are magnified at the level of the primary visual cortex.
```
```Answer
d
```

## 10 (Bonus)
```Question
Fill in the blank: a limited degree of crosstalk between the left and right primary visual cortices via the ______ helps to "stitch" together the two halves of the visual field.
```
```Answer
corpus callosum
```

## 11 (Bonus)
```Question

True
False
```
```Answer
