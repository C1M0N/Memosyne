为什么选 b（Panic，惊恐障碍）
广场恐惧症的核心是：害怕在难以逃离或无法得到及时帮助的场所出现惊恐样症状，从而回避公共交通、商场、排队、开阔/密闭空间、独自外出等。
惊恐障碍以反复且出其不意的惊恐发作与对再次发作的持续担忧（预期性焦虑）为特征。正是这种对“再发”的担心，驱动了对上述情境的回避，最典型地演变为广场恐惧。
DSM-5-TR 中虽把“惊恐障碍”和“广场恐惧症”分为独立诊断，但二者高度共病；临床初筛时优先联动排查惊恐障碍最有价值。

其他选项为什么不如 b：
a. 广泛性焦虑（GAD）：以长期而弥散的担忧为主，不特指“在难以逃离处怕惊恐发作”的情境回避，和广场恐惧的关键机制耦合度更低。
c. 强迫障碍（OCD）：回避多与强迫主题（如污染、伤害意念）相关，并非对惊恐样症状在公共场所发生的担心。
d. 皮肤搔抓障碍：属体聚焦重复行为（BFRB），与“惊恐发作 → 回避 → 广场恐惧”的机制关系较远。
