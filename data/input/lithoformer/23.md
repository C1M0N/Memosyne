```Question
Emily Dickinson (1830–1886), one of America's most celebrated and beloved poets, wrote prolifically and with great transparency about topics such as pain, isolation, and death. Her work, however, was virtually unpublished during her lifetime, and in her private life, she was known for her reclusive nature.

Dickinson grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, in a family that valued a classical education for both women and men. After just one year at Holyoke Female Seminary, however, she returned to the family homestead and stayed there the rest of her life, unmarried and rarely leaving the family property. Although Dickinson corresponded at great length by letter to journalists, editors, and writers during her life, she increasingly restricted her social interactions as time went on, mostly to those within her family.

These behavior patterns, along with writings like the following, have led contemporary scholars to speculate that Dickinson may have had agoraphobia. In an 1853 letter to her friend, Sue Gilbert, she wrote of her feelings upon leaving her family home: I'm just from meeting, Susie, and as I sorely feared, my life was made a victim. I walked – I ran – I turned precarious corners – one moment I was not then soared aloft like Phoenix, soon as the foe was by – and then anticipating an enemy again, my soiled and drooping plumage might have been seen emerging from just behind a fence, vainly endeavoring to fly once more from hence. . . . During the exercises I became more calm, and got out of church quite comfortably. Several roared around me, and, sought to devour me, but I fell an easy prey to Miss Lovinia Dickinson, being too much exhausted to make any further resistance. She entertained me with much sprightly remark, until our gate was reached, and I needn't tell you Susie, just how I clutched the latch, and whirled the merry key, and fairly danced for joy, to find myself at home!

Which of Dickinson's experiences is mentioned in the diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia?
	a. The early life onset of her symptoms
	b. Her focus on topics like pain and death
	c. Her extreme closeness to her family
	d. Her marked fear of being outside her home

```Question
Leonardo DiCaprio is an American actor and producer who first became famous for his role in Titanic and has more recently starred in movies such as The Aviator and Killers of the Flower Moon. He has won an Oscar and three Golden Globes and been nominated for more than 150 other awards.

From childhood on, however, DiCaprio has had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). As an 11-year-old, he was terribly worried about germs and washed his hands excessively. He also struggled with the urge to walk through doors repeatedly and to step on every piece of gum he saw on the pavement. With therapy and medication, he was able to learn to use self-talk to deal with his thoughts and impulses, but then he played inventor and multi-millionaire Howard Hughes, who had severe OCD that apparently was never treated. While playing Hughes, DiCaprio found his own OCD flaring up. "I remember my make-up artist and assistant walking me to The Aviator set and going, 'Oh God, we're going to need 10 minutes to get him there because he has to walk back and step on that thing, touch that door, and walk in and out again.'"

Although he deliberately stopped controlling his OCD to make his portrayal of Hughes more realistic, DiCaprio acknowledges that he continued to struggle: "It became real bothersome, even after the filming." However, he has been able to return to controlling the disorder: "I'm able to say at some point, 'OK, you're being ridiculous, stop stepping on every gum stain you see. You don't need to walk 20 feet back and put your foot on that thing.'"

About half of individuals with OCD experience both obsessions and compulsions while the remainder experience one or the other. What did DiCaprio experience?
	a. Only compulsions
	b. He has an atypical presentation with neither obsessions nor compulsions.
	c. Both obsessions and compulsions
	d. Only obsessions

```Question
Prince Harry, the younger son of King Charles III and Diana, Princess of Wales, would seem to have led a charmed life with every advantage, yet an important part of that life required him to make numerous public appearances, something that became terribly difficult for him. "Before I even left the house [for royal engagements], I was pouring with sweat and my heart was racing. I was in the fight-or-flight mode." In his autobiography, Spare, Harry acknowledged having agoraphobia: "I was an agoraphobe. Which was nearly impossible given my public role." He also acknowledges having used a range of psychoactive substances to cope with this anxiety: "I was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling."

"I saw doctors, I saw therapists, I saw alternative therapists. I saw all sorts of people," Harry reported, but it was not until his late 30s that he began addressing his mental health issues seriously. He is now an advocate for seeking mental health services, noting, "I know there is huge merit in talking about your issues, and the only thing about keeping it quiet is that it's only ever going to make it worse."

Research suggests that individuals with agoraphobia have which innate tendency?
	a. A tendency to overintellectualize their lives
	b. A tendency to deal with difficult situations using humor
	c. A tendency to be chronically angry
	d. A tendency to overreact to normal physical changes

Suppose Harry were to seek therapy for his agoraphobia. His therapist teaches him how to relax his muscles deeply and also asks him to create a hierarchy regarding his agoraphobia, from least fear inducing (for example, talking about an appearance) to most fear inducing (e.g., appearing in front of a large group that is jeering at him). The therapist then pairs the least fear-inducing experience (perhaps through the therapist describing it or even through a virtual reality experience) with relaxation until Harry is comfortable with it, and then gradually works through the hierarchy. What type of therapy is being used?
	a. Cognitive restructuring
	b. Exposure therapy
	c. Systematic desensitization
	d. Modeling

```Question
Scarlett Johansson, an actress and singer, has appeared in numerous movies, including Marriage Story, Jojo Rabbit, and Lost in Translation and as Black Widow in several Marvel movies; on television shows such as Saturday Night Live; and in Broadway shows, including A View from the Bridge and a revival of Cat on A Hot Tin Roof. She also has anxiety accompanied by panic attacks.

She has reported that she has panic attacks at red carpet events and, as a result, tries to avoid them, and even had a panic attack when preparing Thanksgiving dinner. She has also described panic attacks associated with starting a new film, saying, "I usually feel nervous before every film but this time it was a lot worse. I was so nervous that, by the time we were ready for the first scene, I was nearly dead from anxiety." However, she is able to use self-talk to help herself deal with the panic attacks: "I told myself, there's no way this can go on for the next five weeks so I'd better learn to calm myself. And that's exactly what I did. The rest of the filming was the best experiences ever on set after that."

Johansson reports that she is able to talk herself out of experiencing a panic attack. The idea that she can reason her way through the intense physical sensations associated with panic into understanding that those responses do not correspond to the situation and that she is not in grave danger is most consistent with which perspective on panic disorder?
	a. Sociocultural
	b. Biological
	c. Cognitive-behavioral
	d. Learning

```Question
Renee, who has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), has been attempting to complete her medical school prerequisites for a few years now but keeps getting "stuck" because she spends a large part of her day worrying.

As an adult, Renee deals with negative thoughts running through her head and says she wants to "get out of her skin" but cannot. She has difficulty sleeping, eating, and focusing on anything.
