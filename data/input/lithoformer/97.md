# Case Study:
Dissociative Disorders: Felix

## 1
```Question
Name: Felix
Age: 41
Sex: Male
Family: Divorced, four children
Occupation: Software engineer
Presenting problem: Unknown identity

Felix recently entered a restaurant and asked the host to call the local police for him. He stated that he did not know who he was or where he was. The restaurant staff informed him that he was in Pines, Idaho, and that they would gladly try to help him.

The police officers who responded to the call were able to determine Felix's true identity from information in his wallet. While the police were telling him that he had been reported missing two weeks ago and was a software engineer from Wyoming, he began to feel as if he were watching himself in a movie. The officers quickly realized Felix was feeling overwhelmed and arranged for his transport to a nearby hospital.

Medical examination at the hospital revealed that Felix was in good physical health. Urinalysis was negative for alcohol and other drugs, and he had no physical indications of a history of drug use such as the track marks associated with injection drug use. A neurologic exam showed no signs of focal deficits and neuroimaging was within normal limits, as was blood chemistry. A psychiatric consult found Felix to be alert but confused and experiencing a sense of unreality. He denied a history of substance use apart from occasional wine or beer and denied a history or symptoms of depression and anxiety. Felix denied remembering his former life, including having children and other aspects of his personal history. Felix remained in the hospital for observation, and when his former wife visited with their children, he reported that although he did not recognize his children or remember any details about them, he did feel a deep connection to them.

Felix's former wife, with whom he had maintained a good relationship, was able to provide clarity on how this all could have happened. Based on what you know about the development of dissociative disorders, which of the following is the reason she most likely gave for Felix's having gone missing?
	a. Felix was tired of his responsibilities and just wanted to get away.	
	b. Felix's parents, younger sister, her husband, and their children were recently killed in a boating accident.	
	c. Felix has an addiction to prescription opiates, and it was beginning to affect his cognitive functioning.
